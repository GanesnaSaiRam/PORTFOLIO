        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Water conservation is a critical concern in today's world, where wastage poses a significant environmental challenge. One common issue contributing to water waste is the overflow of water tanks. Traditional solutions, such as ball valves, address the problem manually but lack the precision and efficiency needed for optimal water management.</p>
        <p>In response to this, our project introduces a modern and automated solution: a smart water tank management system. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like sensors and Arduino, the system aims to revolutionize the way we measure water levels and monitor water quality. The primary objectives include calculating water levels in real-time and measuring the pH value of the water within the tank.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <p>The core components of this system include Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a pH sensor. These components work in tandem to create a comprehensive monitoring solution. When the water level in the tank reaches a critical point, the system automatically shuts off the pump, preventing overflow and subsequent water wastage. Conversely, when the water level is low, the system activates a buzzer alert, prompting timely refilling.</p>
        <p>The integration of ultrasonic and pH sensors enables precise measurements, providing accurate data on the water level and quality. Arduino, serving as the brain of the system, processes this data in real-time, making informed decisions for automated control.</p>
        <p>This project goes beyond conventional methods, offering an efficient and sustainable approach to water conservation. By addressing both the overflow and low-water scenarios, it not only contributes to environmental preservation but also promotes responsible water usage. The utilization of modern technologies ensures a reliable and user-friendly solution, making it accessible for a wide range of applications and settings.</p>
